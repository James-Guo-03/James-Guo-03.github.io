## Hello. This is James “Siyuan” Guo, and I am a junior at Johns Hopkins University. I major in Mathematics and Computer Science.

I am currently working as a Teaching Assistant for an introductory computing class (`AS.250.205` Introduction to Computing) and the head PILOT (peer-led-team learning) leader for an introductory ODEs class (`AS.110.302` Differential Equations and Applications).

I have volunteered for the International Student at Hopkins (ISAH) organization and Maryland Science Olympiad (MSO) in the past. This year, I will be in charge of the Johns Hopkins Math Tournament (JHMT), which will happen in the upcoming April.
