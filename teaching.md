# Teaching Experience at Johns Hopkins University

In pursuing my experiences in learning, I find teaching an important component of myself. Teaching is an experience when I can better internalize what I have learned, potentially getting deeper in these concepts, and eventually demonstrate them to students.

Here, I will include my teaching and TA experiences through the past years.

## PILOT Learning for `AS.110.302` Differential Equations

PILOT program at Johns Hopkins University is a "recitation"-like seminar for students to learn and practice on selected courses. 
- From Fall 2023 term, I have become the PILOT Leader for this course as an introductory course in ordinary differential equations. Throughout the semester, I compiled together review sheets and problem sheets that delves into the basic concepts of the subjects as well as innovating students with some delicate proofs, aiming to provide students with deeper understandings.
- From Summer 2024 term, I have become the Head for this program. I have organized various review sessions during each semester. At the same time, I have created many practice problems with solutions for students to learn the materials and practice mathematical communications throughout.

## Teaching Assistant for `AS.250.205` Introduction to Computing

I have been the teaching assistant for this introductory computing course since Spring 2023 semester. Throughout the semester, I have had various responsibilities as a teaching assistance.
- Grading and annotating in-class and homework assignments with professor and other Teaching Assistants.
- Maintaining active discussions in class with students addressing problems about coding.
- Empowering students to utilize computing skills to solve problems and create innovative codes
