## Machine Learning: Distance Norm and Weights in Clustering Methods

According to a new article in 2024, Baltimore has been ranked as the "deadliest large city in the nation." This project aims to determine the more efficient implementation of police stations in Baltimore through clustering. Certain innovations that we have tried to include are introducing weights to different crime occurrences and train the model with respect to different distance norms.

## Complex Analysis: Discussing Fourier Series in the Context of Complex Analysis

This project investigates Fourier Series in the context of complex analysis, especially on forming the Fourier Series on a holomorphic periodic function. For the first part, the project will use Fourier series in real analysis as a motivation of writing functions in terms of series, whereas a proof on orthonormal basis utilizes conclusions from complex analysis. Then, we will use the next two parts to investigate the periodic holomorphic function over complex functions. We will first develop the foundations in the first half using factorization theorem, and eventually construct the Fourier series for periodic holomorphic functions with some worked examples.

## Machine Imagination: Investigate Video Generation through Machine Imagination

This essay investigates machine imagination is a new field within machine learning, as it assists on generating texts/images/videos that do not exist based on a database. While scientists are thinking of enhancing and using this technology, we shall evaluate how it is right now and how it will progress in the future. This essay investigates the progress and experiences in this realm and their perspectives on the future of video generation in terms of its application sides.

## Science Olympiad at Maryland

Back in high school, I was a competitor of Science Olympiad at Connecticut. Now in college, I have become an organizer. In the past year I have made problems and organized the JHSOI for *Sound of Music (B)*, and Maryland State competition for *Bridges (C)* and *Optics (B&C)*.

## Mathematics Enrichment for High School Students

Remembering those "old days" learning high school mathematics, I always remember myself lost for what mathematics looks like in college. In 2024, with a chance revisiting my high school during the Intercessions weeks at Hopkins, I have prepared some small lectures in some topics that high school students could comprehend. Eventually, I have developed some notes and slides about Cryptography and Rigor in Mathematics.
- Cryptography Introduction [Notes](/files/crypto-notes.pdf), [Activity Sheet](/files/crypto-activity.pdf), [Slides](/files/crypto-slides.pdf)
- Rigor in Mathematics [Notes](/files/breif_analysis-notes.pdf), [Slides](/files/breif_analysis-lecture_slides.pdf)

## I have decided to include the above selected projects. From some older high school projects, I have decided to keep them still [here](https://sites.google.com/view/jamesguo/past-projects).
