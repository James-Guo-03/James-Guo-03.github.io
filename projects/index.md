## [Southern Regional Council on Statistics (SRCOS) 2025](https://www.srcos.org/src-2025) Presentation

SRCOS aims to improvement of postsecondary education in statistical science, assist in the development of high quality statistics instruction in elementary and high schools, and promulgate educational activities which improve the quality of statistical practices. 

**Title:** Adaptive Kernel Learning in Interacting Particle Systems and their Simulations.

**Abstract:** We introduce a novel adaptive coefficient learning strategy for the non-parametric estimation of the radial interaction kernels in interacting particle systems (IPS), which can be modeled by stochastic differential equations (SDEs). These systems are fundamental in various physical and biological fields, where we typically donâ€™t know the underlying interactive system. Here, we demonstrate the approach with Lennard-Jones kernel on particle system simulation, and the unknown kernel is projected onto orthogonal basis functions, with coefficients initially estimated using the Least Squares Estimator (LSE). Our adaptive learning procedure refines the basis by strategically eliminating less significant coefficients, optimizing selection for more influential basis functions. We present numerical results from 2D simulations, demonstrating the efficacy of this kernel learning approach and discussing its performance with various basis sets.

## Stochastic Differential Equations: Applying Stochastic Differential Equation on the Analysis of Stochastic Gradient Descent

This project investigates the connection between Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) method in machine learning and deep learning and connects to the Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs). By reviewing various published paper, this report builds up upon how SGD process can be modeled and justified by SDEs.

## [Johns Hopkins Math Tournament](https://www.johnshopkinsmathtournament.com/jhmt-2025)

JHMT is an annual math competition for high school students at Johns Hopkins University. For the year 2025, I am in charge of the proof round for high school division and general review on exam questions. At the same time, I gave a talk on "Reintroduction to Probability," which targets high-schoolers and middle-schooler about probability theory and some applications.

## [JHU Undergraduate Math Club](https://sites.google.com/view/jhu-mathclub/seminar#h.s4zw0qfokek4) Talk

**Title**: Hausdorff Measure and Fractal Geometry.

**Abstract**: In this talk, we will explore the motivations and step-by-step construction of Hausdorff measure and Hausdorff dimension for the sets that would have been interpreted as a null set in the Lebesgue measure. Examples with some fractal geometry will be discussed. Audiences are expected to know basic calculus and middle school geometry, but it would be helpful if the audiences are exposed to basic measure theory ideas.

## [Mid-Atlantic Research Exchange (MATRX) 2025](https://www.ams.jhu.edu/matrx2025/to-present/) Presentation

An annual celebration of undergraduate research in mathematics, a forum at which students from the greater Baltimore-DC region may share their recent work either via presentation or poster.

**Title**: Improvement on the Precision of QR Factorization: An Analysis on the Fractional Implementation

**Abstract**: QR factorization is a fundamental algorithm in the field of computational mathematics, whose applications are among solving linear systems, eigenvalue problems, and linear regression. The current computations using classical and modified Gram-Schmidt algorithms are susceptible to floating-point errors, and could lead to catastrophic cancellation. Our project investigates a Q-based fractional computation model to reduce roundoff errors, explores alternatives around certain issues, and analyzes the trade-off between computational complexity and numerical precision. Results show Fractional QR in applications achieves better and arbitrary numerical precision compared to traditional QR factorization methods.

## Machine Learning: Distance Norm and Weights in Clustering Methods

According to a new article in 2024, Baltimore has been ranked as the "deadliest large city in the nation." This project aims to determine the more efficient implementation of police stations in Baltimore through clustering. Certain innovations that we have tried to include are introducing weights to different crime occurrences and train the model with respect to different distance norms.

## Complex Analysis: Discussing Fourier Series in the Context of Complex Analysis

This project investigates Fourier Series in the context of complex analysis, especially on forming the Fourier Series on a holomorphic periodic function. For the first part, the project will use Fourier series in real analysis as a motivation of writing functions in terms of series, whereas a proof on orthonormal basis utilizes conclusions from complex analysis. Then, we will use the next two parts to investigate the periodic holomorphic function over complex functions. We will first develop the foundations in the first half using factorization theorem, and eventually construct the Fourier series for periodic holomorphic functions with some worked examples.

## Machine Imagination: Investigate Video Generation through Machine Imagination

This essay investigates machine imagination is a new field within machine learning, as it assists on generating texts/images/videos that do not exist based on a database. While scientists are thinking of enhancing and using this technology, we shall evaluate how it is right now and how it will progress in the future. This essay investigates the progress and experiences in this realm and their perspectives on the future of video generation in terms of its application sides.

## Science Olympiad at Maryland

Back in high school, I was a competitor of Science Olympiad at Connecticut. Now in college, I have become an organizer. In the past year I have made problems and organized the JHSOI for *Sound of Music (B)*, and Maryland State competition for *Bridges (C)* and *Optics (B&C)*.

## Mathematics Enrichment for High School Students

Remembering those "old days" learning high school mathematics, I always remember myself lost for what mathematics looks like in college. In 2024, with a chance revisiting my high school during the Intercessions weeks at Hopkins, I have prepared some small lectures in some topics that high school students could comprehend. Eventually, I have developed some notes and slides about Cryptography and Rigor in Mathematics.
- Cryptography Introduction [Notes](/projects/crypto-notes.pdf), [Activity Sheet](/projects/crypto-activity.pdf), [Slides](/projects/crypto-slides.pdf)
- Rigor in Mathematics [Notes](/projects/breif_analysis-notes.pdf), [Slides](/projects/breif_analysis-lecture_slides.pdf)

## I have decided to include the above selected projects. From some older high school projects, I have decided to keep them still [here](https://sites.google.com/view/jamesguo/past-projects).
