# Me as a Person

While I would endeavor the academics, I would also devote some time in making something that is not that useful. Here is a secret entry to that!

- [EnDeCript](/EnDeCript/EnDeCript.html)
    - After learning about cryptography and some basic `JavaScript`, I have developed this web-based version to encode and decode English texts.

- [Bear Resort](https://bear-resort.github.io)
    - An organization in which I developed to experiment on more interesting ideas, such as emoji, the Bear Resort worldview is a virtual society.

- I have been maintaining two Instagram accounts which are as follows:
    - [Public Version](http://instagram.com/siyuan_guo/): Where I put most of the experiences that is worth sharing.
    - [Version with Large Variance](https://www.instagram.com/jamesguo_03/): Where I try to post newer and more variant stuffs. Higher variances, so possibly better and worse stuffs there.
